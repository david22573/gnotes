# Chapter 1

## Greeting

**Verses 1-4**
**1:** Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness,
**2:** in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began
**3:** and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior;

**4:** To Titus, my true child in a common faith:

Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

## Qualifications for Elders

**Verses 5-16**
**5:** This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed youâ€”
**6:** if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination.
**7:** For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain,
**8:** but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.
**9:** He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.

**10:** For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party.
**11:** They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach.
**12:** One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
**13:** This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
**14:** not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth.
**15:** To the pure, all things are pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled.
**16:** They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.
