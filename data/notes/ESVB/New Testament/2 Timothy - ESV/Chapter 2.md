# Chapter 2

## A Good Soldier of Christ Jesus

**Verses 1-**
**1:** You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
**2:** and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.
**3:** Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
**4:** No soldier gets entangled in civillian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
**5:** An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
**6:** It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.
**7:** Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.

**8:** Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel,
**9:** for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!
**10:** Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
**11:** The saying is trustworthy, for:
**12-13:**
> If we have died with him, we will also live with him;
> if we endure, we will also reign with him;
> if we deny him, he will also deny us;
> if we are faithless, he remains faithful—

for he cannot deny himself.

## A Worker Approved by God

**Verses 14-26**
**14:** Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers.
**15:** Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
**16:** But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,
**17:** and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
**18:** who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.
**19:** But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from inequity."

**20:** Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable.
**21:** Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work

**22:** So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
**23:** Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.
**24:** And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil,
**25:** correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to knowledge of the truth,
**26:** and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
