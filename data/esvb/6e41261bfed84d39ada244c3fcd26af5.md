## Godlessness in the Last Days

**Verses 1-9**
**1:** But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty.
**2:** For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
**3:** heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good,
**4:** treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
**5:** having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.
**6:** For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions,
**7:** always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
**8:** Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith.
**9:** But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.

## All Scripture Is Breathed Out by God

**Verses 10-17**
**10:** You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,
**11:** my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystraâ€”which persecutions I endured; yet from all the Lord rescued me.
**12:** Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,
**13:** while evil people and imposters will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
**14:** But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it
**15:** and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writing, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
**16:** All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
**17:** that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
