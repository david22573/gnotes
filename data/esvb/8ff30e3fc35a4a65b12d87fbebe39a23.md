# Chapter 4

## The Throne in Heaven

**Verses 1-**
**1:** After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."
**2:** At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne. 
**3:** And he who sat there had an appearance of jasper and carnelian
**4:** Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads.
**5:** From the throne came flashes of lightening, and rumblings and pearls of thunde, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God,
**6:** and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.

And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind:
**7:** the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creatuere like an eagle in flight.
**8:** And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say,
> "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
> who was and is and is to come."

**9:** And whenver the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
**10:** the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
**11:**
> "Worthy are you, our Lord and God,
> to receive glory and honor and power,
> for you created all things,
> and by your will they existed and were created."
