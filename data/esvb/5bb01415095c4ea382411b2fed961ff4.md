## The Scroll and the Lamb

**Verses 1-**
**1:** Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
**2:** And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"
**3:** And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,
**4:** and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
**5:** And one of the elders said to me, "Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals."

**6:** And between the throne and the four creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as thought it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth
**7:** And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
**8:** And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
**9-10:** And they sang a new song, saying,
> "Worthy are you to take the scroll
> and to open its seals,
> for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God
> from every tribe and language and people and nation,
> and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
> and they shall reign on the earth."

**11:** Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
**12:** saying with a loud voice,
> "Worthy is the lamb who was slain,
> to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might
> and honor and glory and blessing!"

**13:** And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying,
> "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
> be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!"

**14:** And the four living creatures said, "Amen!" and the elders fell down and worshiped.
